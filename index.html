            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I was originally born in Souix City, Iowa in 2001. I moved to Norwalk when I was young, and have called it 
              home ever since. Currently I am a senior at the University of Iowa getting a degree in Business Analytics
              & Info Systems, along with an Entrepreneurial Management Degree.
